# AI Usage on Pupils: Impact, Risks, and Opportunities

## Overview

This project explores the **use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools by school pupils** and analyzes their impact on:

* Learning outcomes
* Critical thinking and problem-solving skills
* Academic integrity and dependency risks

As AI tools such as chatbots, tutoring systems, and automated homework assistants become more accessible, understanding **how pupils interact with AI** is critical for educators, policymakers, and edtech developers.

This repository approaches the topic from a **data-driven and ethical AI perspective**, focusing on measurable patterns rather than speculation.

---

## Problem Statement

AI-powered tools are increasingly used by pupils for:

* Homework assistance
* Exam preparation
* Content summarization
* Coding and problem solving

However, concerns remain around:

* Over-reliance on AI-generated answers
* Reduced critical thinking development
* Unequal access to AI tools
* Bias and misinformation

This project asks:

> **How does AI usage correlate with pupil learning behavior and performance?**

---

## Objectives

The goals of this project are to:

* Analyze patterns of AI tool usage among pupils
* Identify positive and negative learning signals
* Explore relationships between AI usage intensity and academic performance
* Highlight ethical and educational implications

---

## Data

The project uses **synthetic and/or anonymized survey-style data** representing:

* Pupil demographics (age group, grade level)
* Frequency of AI tool usage
* Purpose of AI usage (learning, copying, exploration)
* Assessment outcomes
* Self-reported confidence and understanding

Synthetic data is used to:

* Protect minors' privacy
* Simulate realistic classroom scenarios
* Enable controlled experimentation

---

## Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Usage frequency distributions
   * Performance comparisons
   * Correlation analysis

2. **Feature Engineering**

   * AI dependency indicators
   * Learning engagement proxies

3. **Modeling (Exploratory)**

   * Classification of usage patterns
   * Regression analysis on performance outcomes

4. **Ethical Analysis**

   * Bias considerations
   * Fair access concerns
   * Responsible AI usage frameworks

---

## Key Questions Explored

* Does moderate AI usage correlate with improved understanding?
* At what point does AI usage show diminishing returns?
* Are certain subjects more impacted than others?
* What signals indicate unhealthy dependency?

---

## Example Insights (Illustrative)

* Moderate AI-assisted learning correlates with higher confidence scores
* Excessive usage without reflection correlates with lower exam performance
* Guided AI usage shows better outcomes than unrestricted access

## How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnnykeam/ai_usage_on_pupils.git
cd ai_usage_on_pupils
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

---

## Limitations

* Synthetic or self-reported data
* No causal inference (correlation-focused)
* Simplified educational settings

---

## Future Work

* Integrate real anonymized school survey data
* Longitudinal impact analysis
* Subject-specific modeling
* Policy recommendation framework
* Teacher-facing dashboards

---

## Ethical Considerations

This project follows principles of:

* Child data protection
* Responsible AI usage
* Transparency and interpretability

No real pupil data is used in this repository.

---

## Why This Project Matters

AI in education is unavoidable. The key challenge is ensuring it **augments learning rather than replacing thinking**.

This project demonstrates:

* Applied data science in social impact domains
* Ethical AI awareness
* Education-focused ML analysis
